jsoniter (json-iterator) is fast and flexible JSON parser available in [Java](https://github.com/json-iterator/java) and [Go](https://github.com/json-iterator/go)

# Why jsoniter?

* Jsoniter is the fastest JSON parser, it could be up to 10x faster than normal parser, data binding included (shameless self [benchmark](http://jsoniter.com/benchmark.html))
* Having a developer friendly api is our #1 prioprity, you can choose from bind-api, any-api or iterator-api or all of them (checkout your [api choices](http://jsoniter.com/api.html))
* Unique iterator api can iterate through JSON directly, zero memory allocation! (see how [iterator](http://jsoniter.com/api.html#iterator-api) works)
